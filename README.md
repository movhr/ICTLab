# ICTLab
ICTLab was the final development project during my education at the Hogeschool Rotterdam.

The final solution is split up in three parts.
The first part is the resident simulator. This module generates (test) data as if it were a house full of sensor. I made this because there was no data or data structure during this project.
The second part is the web portal. Here you can manage sensors.
The third part is the simulation module. This is a 3D overview of the house (literally) where you can see things happen either live or in the past.
